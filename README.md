# Slot-machine-using-python
This is project aims to develop a model of slot machine commonly seen in casinos and implement its functionality in a similar way.
We take the amount(in dollars), the user wants to play with and then the number of lines he/she wants to bet and finally play the game until they don't have enough money left.
